## University Name

The name of “Tsing Hua” comes from the earliest location “Tsing Hua Garden”.

NTHU, previously known as US Overseas Education Office, established US Graduates Hall in Tsing Hua Garden in 1909. The Office was renamed Tsing Hua Imperial College as the location changed. It was further renamed Tsing Hua School in the following year. In 1928, Nanjing Nationalist Government planned to change Tsing Hua School as Tsing Hua University. After President Luo Chia-lun strove, Tsing Hua School officially became National Tsing Hua University. As reestablished in Hsinchu, it took over the name as National Tsing Hua University.

## University Motto 


In the winter of 1914, scholar Liang Qi-Chao visited the University and delivered a speech on what makes a true gentleman and quoted a passage from Book of Changes (I Ching):

> As heaven maintains vigor through movements,
> A gentleman should constantly strive for self-discipline.
> As earth’s inclusive nature,
> A gentleman should embrace social responsibilities.

This is the origin of the Tsing Hua motto. After the re-establishment in Hsinchu, the motto was written on the outer wall of the Auditorium in the calligraphy of Master Yu You-Ren. The motto has been written in this style ever since.

* Round Version: The former name of NTHU, “Tsing Hua College”, appears at the top of the logo which was adopted by a review committee in 1926. The center of this logo is patterned after the banner of the military training ground in the former Tsing Hua Imperial College.

* Bird Shape Version: Worn as a badge during the Beijing period, it also serves as the logo for NTHU in Hsinchu.

## University Flower

It has been claimed that early emblems consisted of a bauhinia or clove image, but there is no firm evidence supporting this claim. NTHU in Hsinchu is often symbolized by a plum blossom in memory of the great leader of Tsing Hua on both sides of the Taiwan Strait Mei Yi-Chi and his great contributions to the University and Nation. The University Council adopted the plum blossom as the official flower of NTHU in Hsinchu in 2011.
